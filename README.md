# prediction-evapotranspiration-
In this algorithm, I will estimate the evapotranspiration for Ceara weather by Neural Network using Python. Predicting evapotranspiration is a big challenge since it depends on several climatic factors and most of them require expensive equipment to be measured. Therefore, new methods are extremely needed.Several simulations are going to be performed to find the best parameters that fit this problem. Also, the number of features and the amount of data will be reduced to discover the minimum of information needed to reach a reasonable result. thus, all combinations of the following hyperparameters are going to be tested and stored on JSON to make a comparison after the prediction is over.
